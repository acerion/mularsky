	Implementing basic operations on pressure sensor (BME280).

	I thought that I could use WiringPi's read and write functions,
	but it turns out that regular read() and write() functions work
	just fine.

	At this point I'm not using files from src/pressure
	directory. Pressure sensor is configured with very simple code in
	main() and then data is read with even simpler code in main(),
	without usage of functions or definitions from src/pressure. Maybe
	I will use that code for compensation. For now I'm relying on data
	(register descriptions, configuration values etc.) from datasheet.
