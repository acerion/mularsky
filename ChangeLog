	Adding files for starting and stopping mularsky program through
	systemd.

	IMU:

	Committing code that actually reads some info from IMU chip, so
	now it's a matter of reading chip's spec and implementing rest of
	interesting parts.


	I2C:

	I will need to have two I2C devices in /dev on my RPi: one
	accessible through standard I2C driver and pins, and one
	accessible through driver that does bit-banging on GPIOs. The
	second one is for IMU that requires clock stretching. Clock
	stretching is not supported by the first driver.

	IMU:

	First commit of template code for communicating with IMU chip
	(BNO055).

	Pressure sensor:

	Removing from Bosch's files all code that is not directly related
	to calculating of compensated values of measurements. Compensation
	of measurements is the only thing that I will need from Bosch's
	files in my project. bme280_support.c has been removed entirely.

	Pressure sensor:

	Beginning to use compensation functions from Bosch's files. This
	means that I'm able to read actual values of pressure, temperature
	and humidity.

	Pressure sensor:

	Implementing basic operations on pressure sensor (BME280).

	I thought that I could use WiringPi's read and write functions,
	but it turns out that regular read() and write() functions work
	just fine.

	At this point I'm not using files from src/pressure
	directory. Pressure sensor is configured with very simple code in
	main() and then data is read with even simpler code in main(),
	without usage of functions or definitions from src/pressure. Maybe
	I will use that code for compensation. For now I'm relying on data
	(register descriptions, configuration values etc.) from datasheet.
